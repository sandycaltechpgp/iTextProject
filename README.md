# iTextProject

This project is a Java project. 
In this project I convert some images of few forms to editable PDFs using iText library.
Every single box in the pdf is handcoded and has a corresponding code associated with it.

I have also tried to reuse some of the things which are common across the different PDFs to save time. 

Please see the target folder for final PDF forms. </br>

HAPPING CODING ! </br>

Thanks </br>
